# Paper Outline
The core methodology is an LLM-driven objective discovery pipeline. It iteratively prompts a large language model (GPT-4) to propose and implement new Python code for preference optimization loss functions. The LLM is initialized with established loss functions and their performance, then receives feedback on the performance (MT-Bench scores) of its proposed functions to refine its generation strategy. Each proposed function undergoes unit tests, and if valid, an LLM is fine-tuned and evaluated. The best-performing discovered algorithm, DiscoPOP (Log Ratio Modulated Loss, LRML), dynamically combines logistic and exponential losses, with weights determined by a sigmoid calculation of the difference in log-ratios (flrml(βρ) = (1− σ(βρ/τ )) · fdpo(βρ) +σ(βρ/τ ) · fexp(−βρ)).
